Suhas Abdullah is a Computer Science and Engineering student with a deep curiosity for emerging technologies. A dedicated learner and thoughtful communicator, Suhas is also a teacher, helping others understand complex topics with clarity and empathy. Beyond his technical prowess, Suhas is known for his compelling writing and speech-giving skills, often blending logic with emotion in ways that resonate with both heart and mind.

He is the mind behind two socially impactful platforms: **Greenblox** and **SupplyHope**.

Greenblox is a decentralized application (dApp) aimed at carbon offset tracking. Built using **Solidity**, **Ethers.js**, **Hardhat**, **React**, **MongoDB**, and **Express**, it involves entities like:
- Project Developers: who manage renewable energy projects (e.g., solar, wind, hydro).
- Developers (industry CO₂ emitters): who purchase carbon credits.
- Regulators: who verify NGOs or projects before allowing system access.
- Auditors: who conduct independent verification of carbon offset claims.

SupplyHope, another impactful project, connects donors with NGOs to facilitate the donation of food, clothes, blood, and stationery. It prioritizes relevance, quality, and timing. For instance, NGOs can declare summer clothes campaigns, and donors will be matched based on proximity, donation suitability, and NGO needs. It also incorporates chat features and notification systems.

Suhas's technological journey has included:
- Learning **Solidity smart contracts**, and deploying them using **Hardhat**.
- Using **Alchemy** to interact with Ethereum from the backend.
- Handling file structure conventions like `smart-contract/ignition/modules/deploy.js`.
- Writing structured Mongoose models without default values.
- Making MetaMask popups work for transaction approvals.
- Building Flask-based APIs to serve machine learning models for CO₂ reduction predictions.
- Storing smart contract ABI and address in the backend for frontend interaction.

He has also experimented with **LangChain**, **Qdrant**, **TextLoader**, and **CharacterTextSplitter**, successfully implementing RAG pipelines and testing them with content like *Homer's Odyssey*.

Suhas is also preparing to participate in the **NASA Space Apps Challenge**, a global hackathon, which aligns with his passion for solving real-world problems through code and collaboration.

In his personal life, Suhas has a girlfriend whom he cares about deeply. He prefers comfort that is layered, thoughtful, and emotionally intelligent.

Suhas's birthday is **July 10**, and he recently celebrated it with personal reflections and new learning milestones—like solving the 90-degree matrix rotation problem on his own.

He loves the Unix/Linux command line and is currently exploring the `tr` command for text transformations. He uses **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** as his primary development environment.

In July 2024, Suhas began refining a rebellious and poetic voice, especially toward religious hypocrisy and silence in the face of Bangladesh's social crisis. His writing has started to fuse political awareness with literary imagination.

Suhas is not just a builder of systems—but of meaning. Whether it's on-chain carbon offsets, offline donation matching, or offering comfort to a loved one in pain, he crafts things that matter.

EXPANDED BIOGRAPHY
====================

**Early Life and Education**

Suhas Abdullah was born on July 10th in Dhaka, Bangladesh, to a family that valued both education and social responsibility. From an early age, he displayed an unusual combination of analytical thinking and emotional intelligence. His parents, both educators, instilled in him a deep respect for knowledge and the power of technology to transform lives.

Growing up in Bangladesh during the early 2000s, Suhas witnessed the rapid digital transformation of his country. He was fascinated by how computers could solve complex problems and connect people across vast distances. By the age of 12, he was already tinkering with basic programming concepts, starting with HTML and CSS to create simple websites for his school projects.

His academic journey was marked by excellence in mathematics and science, but what truly set him apart was his ability to explain complex concepts to his peers. Teachers often asked him to help struggling students, recognizing his natural teaching abilities. This early experience as a mentor would later influence his approach to building user-friendly applications.

**University Years and Technical Foundation**

When Suhas entered university to study Computer Science and Engineering, he was immediately drawn to emerging technologies. His first year was spent mastering fundamental programming concepts in Python, Java, and C++. However, it was during his second year that he discovered blockchain technology and its potential for social impact.

The concept of decentralized applications fascinated him. He spent countless hours studying Ethereum's white paper, understanding smart contracts, and experimenting with Solidity. His first smart contract was a simple voting system, but it opened his eyes to the possibilities of blockchain beyond cryptocurrency.

During this period, Suhas also developed a keen interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence. He took additional courses in data structures, algorithms, and database management systems. His project work included building recommendation systems and natural language processing applications.

**The Greenblox Project: Carbon Offset Revolution**

The idea for Greenblox came to Suhas during a particularly hot summer in Dhaka. He was reading about climate change and carbon markets when he realized that blockchain technology could provide the transparency and trust needed for carbon offset trading.

Greenblox was conceived as a comprehensive platform that would connect renewable energy project developers with companies seeking to offset their carbon emissions. The platform uses smart contracts to ensure that carbon credits are legitimate and cannot be double-counted.

The technical architecture of Greenblox is sophisticated. It uses Solidity for smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum network, with Hardhat as the development framework. The frontend is built with React and uses Ethers.js for blockchain interactions. The backend uses Express.js with MongoDB for data persistence.

One of the most challenging aspects was implementing the verification system. Suhas designed a multi-layered approach where regulators can verify projects, auditors can conduct independent reviews, and smart contracts automatically enforce compliance rules. The system also includes a prediction model built with Flask that estimates carbon reduction potential based on historical data.

**SupplyHope: Bridging Generosity with Need**

SupplyHope emerged from Suhas's observation that while many people wanted to donate goods to NGOs, there was no efficient way to match donors with organizations that actually needed their specific donations. The platform addresses this problem through intelligent matching algorithms.

The system considers multiple factors: geographical proximity, the type of donation needed, urgency, and the NGO's current capacity. For example, if an NGO declares a need for winter clothes, the system will match them with donors who have appropriate clothing and are located within a reasonable distance.

SupplyHope's technical stack includes React for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, and MongoDB for data storage. The platform also incorporates real-time chat functionality and push notifications to keep donors and NGOs connected.

Biography of Prithu Anan: A Mind in Motion

=== EARLY LIFE AND BACKGROUND ===

Prithu Anan was born in 2000 in Dhaka, Bangladesh, into a family where love was constant, even when life was not always easy. His childhood was not one of extravagance, but one of exploration. He was the kind of child who disassembled remote controls just to see what was inside — not to break things, but to understand how they worked.

From early on, Prithu displayed a restless curiosity. He asked "why" more often than most people had answers for. His parents, thankfully, never discouraged this trait. They let him explore, stumble, and build his own mental frameworks. This simple encouragement would later become the foundation of how he approaches life: questioning everything, accepting nothing at face value.

=== ACADEMIC JOURNEY ===

**Early Education and Intellectual Development**

In school, Prithu wasn't always the top scorer, but he was always the one asking the odd questions. He remembers once, in a math class, when the teacher gave a straightforward equation — and while the others solved it, Prithu asked, "Why does this method work in the first place?" That question led him into a rabbit hole of number theory. He didn't get extra marks that day, but he did gain a deeper understanding — and a hint that maybe he was wired a bit differently.

Computers entered Prithu's life in his early teens. At first, he played games. Then he wanted to make them. He learned to code not because someone told him to, but because it felt like unlocking a superpower. His world changed when he realized that a few lines of code could make a screen come alive. That thrill has never left him.

**BUET Years – Academic Rigor and Growth**

Getting into BUET was a dream for many students around him, and Prithu was no exception. It was 2020, and the world outside was in chaos due to the pandemic. But inside the gates of BUET — whether physical or virtual — he found structure, intensity, and challenge like never before.

CSE at BUET isn't just a course of study; it's a culture. The pace is relentless. Assignments don't wait. Time moves differently here — a week feels like a day, a night feels like an hour. But Prithu learned. Not just the subjects — algorithms, data structures, operating systems — but something deeper: resilience. The ability to push through, debug for hours, and still show up the next day for a quiz.

What made it worth it was the community. His batchmates and he formed bonds forged in sleepless nights and whiteboard battles. They weren't just studying — they were building, breaking, competing, and evolving. Every project felt like a startup; every group assignment felt like a war room.

=== COMPETITIVE ACHIEVEMENTS ===

**Cybersecurity and iCTF**

Even while managing the academic load, Prithu sought more — a sandbox where theory met reality. That search led him to a diverse set of competitions.

One of the most formative was iCTF, an international Capture the Flag cybersecurity contest hosted by UCSB. Prithu joined a ten-person team made up of members from BUET CSE'20 and CSE'21. They spent hours analyzing binary exploits, reverse engineering code, and probing systems for vulnerabilities. The adrenaline was real. So was the teamwork. Each of them brought different strengths, and the synergy was electric.

**Geographic Intelligence and Pin Point on Map**

Then came something entirely different: Pin Point on Map — a geography-based game that tested one's ability to deduce location from an image. To many, it might sound mundane. But to Prithu, it was an intellectual playground. A palm tree hinted at Southeast Asia; a power line style suggested Eastern Europe. He loved the challenge of visual reasoning. It reminded him that intelligence isn't one-dimensional.

**Data Science and Kaggle**

And then there was Kaggle. Kaggle changed how Prithu thought about data. It wasn't just about cleaning CSVs or tuning models. It was about storytelling — finding truth in numbers. He took part in a unique problem: generating detailed solutions to math Olympiad questions in Bengali. That experience pushed him to balance technical fluency with linguistic clarity, and made him realize how deep the rabbit hole of machine learning goes.

=== TECHNICAL EXPERTISE ===

=== PERSONAL GROWTH AND RESILIENCE ===

**Overcoming Challenges**

Of course, not everything was smooth in Prithu's journey. He has had projects crash days before the deadline. He has stared at screens for hours, unable to fix a single bug. He has dealt with imposter syndrome — wondering if he was good enough, smart enough, capable enough.

But every time he failed, he learned. He learned to ask for help when needed. He learned that perfection is the enemy of progress. He learned that some breakthroughs come at 4 AM, after hours of nothing working.

And slowly, he built confidence. Not arrogance — but a quiet, persistent belief that he can figure things out, given enough time and effort.

**Learning Philosophy**

Prithu believes in continuous learning and intellectual growth. His approach combines:
- Hands-on experimentation with new technologies
- Theoretical understanding of fundamental concepts
